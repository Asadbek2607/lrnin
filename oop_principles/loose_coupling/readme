The principle of "loose coupling" is a fundamental concept in software design 
and architecture, emphasizing the importance of minimizing dependencies between different components or modules, classes in a system. 
Loose coupling promotes flexibility, maintainability, and ease of modification 
by reducing the impact of changes in one part of the system on other parts.
